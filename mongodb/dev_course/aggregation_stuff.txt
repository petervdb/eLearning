Aggregation Framework in MongoDB
---------------------------------------------------------
Show number of products grouped by manufacturer:
db.products.aggregate([ {$group: { _id:"$manufacturer", num_products:{$sum: 1} } } ])
Show number of products grouped by category:
db.products.aggregate( [ {$group: { _id: "$category", "num_products": {$sum: 1} } } ])

Aggregation pipeline
$project -> reshape document = 1 to 1
$match -> filter = n to 1
$group -> aggregate = n to 1
$sort -> sort = 1 to 1
$skip -> skips = n to 1
$limit -> limits = n to 1
$unwind -> normalize = 1 to n
$out -> output = 1 to 1
