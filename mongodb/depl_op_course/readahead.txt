Readahead
-------------------------------------------------
Spinned disks: takes a long time to get there. 2ed page reads much faster.
Is not so important with SSD drives.
Readahead: number of extra sectors to be read for any disk access.
# sudo blockdev --report
RA: 256 -> 256 x 512 byte sectors = 128 Kbytes data
When good locality -> next data is in 128k block.
Unfortunately, MongoDB is not very good in locality, except for oplog and capped collections.
Seeks = expensive (but not for SSD drives)
