MongoDB Deployment and intrastructure maintenance - Chapter 3
-------------------------------------------------------------

Rolling maintenance
-------------------
You need at least 3 nodes.
Oplog needs to be big enough.

Performing maintenance
----------------------
Shutdown instance
Startup without --replSet and on a different port!
Perform maintenance
Shutdown and startup with --replSet and on the original port.

Wait before the secondary catch up before starting the maintenance on the other secondary server.
Perform rs.stepDown() on primary to gracefully promote a secondary to become primary.

Use cases
----------
- Upgrading the binaries
- Index builds. First on secondary, stepdown primary and repeat process
- Compact / Repair

Load Balancers
--------------
No, if you are using a replica set.
Yes, if you are sharding
But be carefull. LB needs to be configured correctly.

Driver options
--------------
Throw exception is the default. But you can set on retry.
Connection timeout.
Generic - most familiar with the Java driver.
Connections per host.
Count about 1M for each connection. 10000 connections -> 10GB RAM

Socket TimeOut
--------------
Default value is infinite
Be carefull when setting timeouts!!!

High Availability
-----------------
Use a list of MongoClients when using mongos.

Connection management in replica set
------------------------------------
